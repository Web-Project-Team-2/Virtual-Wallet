## Installation

To start the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Docker installed. All dependencies are managed via Docker, so you don't need to install anything manually except Docker.

3. **Start the application**:
    Use Docker Compose to build and run the project:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4. **Install Python dependencies**:
    The project includes a `requirements.txt` file for Python dependencies. If you need to set up a local environment for development or testing outside of Docker, you can install these dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

After completing these steps, the application should be up and running. You can access it via the URL specified in your Docker configuration, typically `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage üöÄ

Once the server starts, you can find the web functionality at `http://localhost:8000`.

From the user's profile, you can:
- Create a card
- Deposit funds
- Withdraw funds
- Edit your profile
- Log out

Refer to the project documentation or contact the development team for additional configuration or troubleshooting.
